Ubiquitium
---------------- 
![](share/pixmaps/nsis-header.bmp)

I want to introduce a new scrypt blockchain with no pre-mine.  As with most blockchains, we will develop this coin over time.  Today, we start with the ANN, wallets, Github, and pool.  The Ubiquitium Blockchain is a community project that will see many upgrades over time.

The words ubiquitous and ubique mean everywhere.  We modelled this coin with the concept of everywhere in mind.  The Ubiquitium Blockchain is about being everywhere and belongs to everyone. 

Block times are fast at 20 seconds, with a difficulty correction after ten blocks.  POW mining rewards start at 100 per block.  We designed it to half after block 3,153,600, or roughly every two years, with a total coin supply of 630,720,000.  This coin is a fork of Litecoin 0.18.1 (the current version) with SegWit active.
